        <h2>About Us</h2><br>
        <p>Matrix University was founded in 1998 with a bold vision: to become a beacon of innovation and excellence in a rapidly changing digital world. The university’s name, Matrix, symbolizes the interconnectedness of knowledge, technology, and human potential—an idea that continues to define our philosophy today.

        Originally established as a small institute for advanced computer science and engineering in NeoCity, Matrix University quickly gained a reputation for cutting-edge research and forward-thinking education. Recognizing the growing importance of interdisciplinary learning, Matrix expanded to include programs in biotechnology, digital arts, business analytics, and space sciences.</p>

        <br>

        <p>From its humble beginnings in a repurposed tech warehouse with just 50 students, Matrix University has grown into a globally respected institution with over 20,000 students across four campuses worldwide. Our commitment to technological progress, ethics in innovation, and inclusive education has helped shape leaders, thinkers, and creators who are ready to tackle the challenges of tomorrow.

        At Matrix University, we believe that education is the code of the future—and we're here to help you write yours.</p>
